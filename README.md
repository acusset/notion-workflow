# Cloudflare Workflows

This is the starter template for Workflows, a durable execution engine built on top of Cloudflare Workers.

* Clone this repository to get started with Workflows
* Read the [Workflows announcement blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/building-workflows-durable-execution-on-workers/) to learn more about what Workflows is and how to build durable, multi-step applications using the Workflows model.
* Review the [Workflows developer documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/) to dive deeper into the Workflows API and how it works.

## Usage

**Visit the [get started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/get-started/guide/) for Workflows to create and deploy your first Workflow.**

### Deploy it

Deploy it to your own Cloudflare account directly:

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/workflows-starter)

You can also create a project using this template by using `npm create cloudflare@latest`:

```sh
npm create cloudflare@latest workflows-starter -- --template "cloudflare/workflows-starter"
```

This will automatically clone this repository, install the dependencies, and prompt you to optionally deploy:

```sh
